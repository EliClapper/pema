Description: Conduct penalized meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, there are
    often between-study differences. These can be coded as moderator variables,
    and controlled for using meta-regression. However, if the number of
    moderators is large relative to the number of studies, such an analysis may
    be overfitted. Penalized meta-regression is useful in these cases, because
    it shrinks the regression slopes of irrelevant moderators towards zero.
